### To-Do List Application in Python

#### Purpose of the Project:

The to-do list application is a simple console-based program written in Python. 
Its purpose is to help users keep track of tasks or activities they need to accomplish. 
The application allows users to:

1. **Display To-Do List:** View the list of tasks.
2. **Add Task:** Add a new task to the list.
3. **Remove Task:** Remove a task from the list.
4. **Quit:** Exit the application.

#### How to Run the Code:

Follow these step-by-step instructions to run the to-do list application:

1. **Install Python:**
   - Ensure that Python is installed on your computer. 
 If not, you can download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Create a New Python File:**
   - Open a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice (e.g., 
   Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or IDLE).

3. **Copy the Code:**
   - Copy the provided Python code for the to-do list application.

4. **Paste the Code:**
   - Paste the copied code into your text editor or IDE.

5. **Save the File:**
   - Save the file with a meaningful name and the `.py` extension. For example, you could name it `todo_app.py`.

6. **Run the Code:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt in the same directory where you saved your Python file.

   - Type the following command and press Enter to run the application:
     ```bash
     python todo_app.py
     ```
     or
     ```bash
     python3 todo_app.py
     ```
     Note: The exact command may vary based on your operating system and Python installation.

7. **Interact with the To-Do List:**
   - Once the application is running, you'll see a menu with options (1-4). Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with your to-do list.

8. **Quit the Application:**
   - When you're done using the application, choose option 4 to quit.

#### Additional Notes:

- The application uses a text file (`todo.txt`) to store tasks. Make sure the Python script and the `todo.txt` file are in the same directory.
  
- If the `todo.txt` file doesn't exist initially, the application will create it when you add your first task.

- Feel free to customize the code or add more features as you become more comfortable with Python programming.

By following these steps, you should be able to run the to-do list application and explore its functionality. 
This project serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to Python programming and basic file handling concepts.
